# This is my website redesign repo
This is where all the source code for my website is, and where all my project info is also at! So this code is very important to my domain.
I also use this code as a template for other websites so it has close design to this website unless I make a joke website like drinkwater.mrpugpug.com with google sites, or use html
Its under the MIT license so remember that you have to credit me for it if you use it!
